# pga309-blutooth-android-tensometer
##Bachelor project.
```The purpose of this project is to measure tensions with use of tensometers and pga309 in the sensor bridge configuration. Data will be sent to the android phone (which will plot it) over Bluetooth. All of the components will be connected to the Funduino Mega 2560 R3 for ease of development.
